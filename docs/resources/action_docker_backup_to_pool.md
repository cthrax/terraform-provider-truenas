  Create a backup of existing apps on `target_pool`.  This creates a backup of existing apps on the `target_pool` specified. If this is executed multiple times, in the next iteration it will incrementally backup the apps that have changed since the last backup.  Note: This will stop the docker service (which means current active apps will be stopped) and then start it again after snapshot has been taken of the current apps dataset.

# truenas_action_docker_backup_to_pool (Resource)

Create a backup of existing apps on `target_pool`.  This creates a backup of existing apps on the `target_pool` specified. If this is executed multiple times, in the next iteration it will incrementally backup the apps that have changed since the last backup.  Note: This will stop the docker service (which means current active apps will be stopped) and then start it again after snapshot has been taken of the current apps dataset.

This is an action resource that executes the `docker.backup_to_pool` operation. Actions are triggered on resource creation and cannot be undone on destroy.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "truenas_action_docker_backup_to_pool" "example" {
  target_pool = "value"
}
```

## Schema

### Input Parameters

- `target_pool` (String, Required) Name of the storage pool to backup Docker data to.

### Computed Outputs

- `action_id` (String) Unique identifier for this action execution
- `job_id` (Int64) Background job ID (if applicable)
- `state` (String) Job state: SUCCESS, FAILED, or RUNNING
- `progress` (Float64) Job progress percentage (0-100)
- `result` (String) Action result data
- `error` (String) Error message if action failed

## Notes

- Actions execute immediately when the resource is created
- Background jobs are monitored until completion
- Progress updates are logged during execution
- The resource cannot be updated - changes force recreation
- Destroying the resource does not undo the action
