This is an action resource that executes the `pool.attach` operation. Actions are triggered on resource creation and cannot be undone on destroy.

resource "truenas_action_pool_attach" "example" {
  oid = 1
  options = "value"
}
```

## Schema

### Input Parameters

- `oid` (Int64, Required) ID of the pool to attach a disk to.
- `options` (String, Required) Configuration for the disk attachment operation.

### Computed Outputs

- `action_id` (String) Unique identifier for this action execution
- `job_id` (Int64) Background job ID (if applicable)
- `state` (String) Job state: SUCCESS, FAILED, or RUNNING
- `progress` (Float64) Job progress percentage (0-100)

## Notes

- Actions execute immediately when the resource is created
- Background jobs are monitored until completion

- The resource cannot be updated - changes force recreation
- Destroying the resource does not undo the action
