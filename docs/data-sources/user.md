### Read-Only

- `api_keys` (List) - Array of API key IDs associated with this user account for programmatic access.
- `builtin` (Bool) - If `true`, the user account is an internal system account for the TrueNAS server. Typically, one should     create dedicated user accounts for access to the TrueNAS server webui and shares.

- `home` (String) - The local file system path for the user account's home directory. Typically, this is required only if the account has shell access (local or SSH) to TrueNAS. This is not required for accounts used onl
- `immutable` (Bool) - If `true`, the account is system-provided and most fields related to it may not be changed.
- `last_password_change` (String) - The date of the last password change for local user accounts.

- `password_age` (Int64) - The age in days of the password for local user accounts.
- `password_change_required` (Bool) - Password change for local user account is required on next login.
- `password_disabled` (Bool) - If set to `true` password authentication for the user account is disabled.  NOTE: Users with password authentication disabled may still authenticate to the TrueNAS server by other methods,     such as
- `password_history` (List) - This contains hashes of the ten most recent passwords used by local user accounts, and is     for enforcing password history requirements as defined in system.security.
- `roles` (List) - Array of roles assigned to this user's groups. Roles control administrative access to TrueNAS through     the web UI and API.

- `ssh_password_enabled` (Bool) - Allow the user to authenticate to the TrueNAS SSH server using a password.  WARNING: The established best practice is to use only key-based authentication for SSH servers.
- `sshpubkey` (String) - SSH public keys corresponding to private keys that authenticate this user to the TrueNAS SSH server.
- `sudo_commands` (List) - An array of commands the user may execute with elevated privileges. User is prompted for password     when executing any command from the array.
